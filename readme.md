# Aptos Tic-Tac-Toe

## Introduction
This is a simple multiplayer tic-tac-toe smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain. It allows players to create new games, make moves, and track the game state.

## Vision
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the basics of building a decentralized game on the Aptos platform. By providing a simple and accessible tic-tac-toe implementation, we hope to encourage developers to explore the capabilities of Aptos and build their own blockchain-based games and applications.

## Future Goals
- Implement features to handle game draws and allow players to join/leave games
- Explore the integration of Aptos tokens and NFTs to enhance the game experience
- Expand the contract to support additional game modes and customization options
- Investigate the use of Aptos' smart contract upgradability to maintain and improve the game over time
